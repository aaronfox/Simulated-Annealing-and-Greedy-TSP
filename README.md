To run the following code it would be useful to have a Python IDE or the code can be run from console.

# To change the experimentation of the number of cities tested one would have to edit salesman.py and edit line #332 to the array of cities they desire we currently have (30,20,10 & 5)

# The code that will give all of the analytics desired for the parrallel simulated approach vs the greedy approach can be found by running salesman.py 
# by running salesman.py one will see all of the analytics in the console as well at matplotlib charts looking at a variety of different sets of data
